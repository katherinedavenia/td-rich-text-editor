## Hello there! ðŸŒ±âœ¨<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexandre-abrioux/alexandre-abrioux/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

### This is a simple Rich Text Editor created using [Slate.js](https://www.slatejs.org/)!

If you're curious with Slate.js, take a look of what I've built thru this link: [td-rich-text-editor.vercel.app](https://td-rich-text-editor.vercel.app/) ðŸ˜„, and if you wanna play around with this simple overview, then you can use my repo and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev # or yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You should also totally modify and improve what I've already built! :hammer:
